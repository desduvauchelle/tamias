Growthinator — project folder

Website: https://www.growthinator.com

Notes:
- The site appears to be heavily client-side / JS-driven. A basic HTTP fetch returned mostly runtime and bundle markup, so I couldn't reliably extract static meta like the title/description.
- If you want a full scrape (hero copy, features, pricing, screenshots), I can run a headless browser (Puppeteer) and capture the rendered DOM. Tell me if you want that.

What's here:
- This folder (growthinator/) with this README as a placeholder.

Suggested next steps:
- Decide if you want a README with target audience, key metrics, and positioning — I can draft one based on your input.
- Provide access (or permission) to create a Discord channel in your server (see note below).

Discord channel request:
- You asked me to create a Discord channel for Growthinator. I can't create channels without a Discord bot or access to your server. If you want me to create the channel programmatically, provide:
  - A bot token (or add the bot I provide) with Manage Channels permission
  - The Discord server (guild) ID where the channel should be created
  - Any channel name, topic, and category preferences

If you prefer, I can instead provide a one-click invite / step-by-step script for you to run that will create the channel, or draft the channel topic and pinned messages for you to paste.
