What I created here:
- This repository folder (livecase/) with this README containing the scraped homepage summary and links.

Suggested next steps (pick one):
- Extract and save the main marketing assets (logo, key images) — need explicit permission to download and store.
- Build a product one-pager (value props, target audience, metrics) for outreach.
- Create a list of potential customer segments and messaging experiments.

If you want, I can:
- Pull more structured data from the site (pricing, docs TOC, case studies) using a headless browser if needed.
- Draft marketing copy / one-pager based on the above.
