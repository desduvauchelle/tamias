LILA PA — project folder

LILA PA (school) — folder initialized.

Short notes:
- You are the president of LILA. This folder is a place to keep school docs, meeting notes, agendas, and communications.

What's here:
- This README (basic)
- I can create a Discord channel for LILA PA if you provide bot access / server ID (see Growthinator notes). Alternatively I can draft the channel name, topic, and pinned messages for you to create manually.

Suggested next steps:
- Add a NOTES.md with current tasks or meeting minutes.
- Create a simple folder structure: meetings/, documents/, contacts/, communications/

Tell me how you want the initial structure and I’ll create it.
